# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the existing html code and style sheet to use more semantic html tags and improve the organization and structure of the code.  In addition, one of the links in the navigation bar was repaired, and the aside was repositioned to align with the body better.

Another change included adding alt tags to all the images, to improve accessibility for visually impaired users with screen readers.

This project enabled me to improve my understanding of html and css structure and use, as well as improve my ability to use the Github repo, practice pull requests, and creating/closing issues.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
